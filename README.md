# Django Core Kit

**Django Core Kit** is a base template and toolkit designed to simplify the creation and initialization of **Django** projects from scratch.

It includes ready-to-use integrations and scripts for platforms such as **NetBox**, **Wagtail**, **Rocket.Chat**, and more.

Its purpose is to provide a solid and extensible starting point for developers who want to quickly set up a Django environment with pre-integrated patterns, modules, and best practices.
